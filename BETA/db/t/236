name	(236,877)	$ Temple Garden
desc	(236,877)	$ The temple opens into a vast garden, sparsly decorated with beautiful
trees and flowers.  A monk sits here in full lotus, gently concentrating
on nothing.  To the west, a red silk curtain flows slightly in the
breeze, hiding the garden's exit through a gigantic archway.
