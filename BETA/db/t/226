name	(226,877)	$ Temple of Ne''ack
desc	(226,877)	$ The inside of the temple seems infinitely more peaceful than the
frightening entrance (south).  A large circle of marble supports an
ebony altar in the center of this room.  Off to the west is a
sparkling blue fountain, and off to the east a red silk curtain acts
as a door to a large archway.
