$ This indeed seems, for they are actions that a man might play. 
But I have that within which passes show, these are but the trappings
and the suits of woe.
$ Oh that this too too sallied flesh would melt,
thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
$ How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
seem to me all the uses of this world!
$ One may smile, and smile, and be a villain!
$ There are more things in heaven and earth, friend,
than are dreampt of in your philosophy.
$ Friend, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.
$ This world is a prison!  A goodly one, in which there are
many confines, wards, and dungeons; this land being one o' th' worst.
$ I am but mad north-north-west.  When the wind is southerly I know a hawk
from a hand-saw.
