name	(279,877)	$ Fountain
desc	(279,877)	$ A beautiful fountain creates a thin mist of water throughout this
entire worshipping chamber.  The fountain, a black marble gargoyle,
grimices as if in pleasure and intense pain as a stream of water
flows from his mouth.  Below the gargoyle, a pool of peaceful liquid
reflects light onto the domed ceiling.
