name	(229,877)	$ Forest Waterfall
desc	(229,877)	$ The forest suddenly drops off here as the forest turns into a sharp cliff,
almost as if the other half of the mountain has been sliced away.
The river, turning into a huge waterfall, sprays up mist all about you.
The trail leads west, and a rickety bridge leads across the face of the 
waterfall to the south.
