desc	(17,73)	$ The (seemingly) only priest of this temple, Devteem busies himself with
leading adventurers astray, chidding them to hack and slash monsters,
and inviting them to explore the darkest recesses of dungeon misery.
His right hand tightly grips a thick book which he often points to,
and his left hand's fingers are ornamented with many rings.
speech	(17,219)	A 5
$ An adventurer's only true loyalty is to the temple!  Hack, Slash,
and sacrafice, yea gods!
$ Sacrafices take place every Sunday at noon.  Don't miss a single one!
$ Brave adventurers never flee an enemy, no matter what their injury.
$ Dungeon's are an adventurer's only home...  also his only place of 
employment.
$ Never be swayed by false deities.  Ne''ack is the only true immortal!
