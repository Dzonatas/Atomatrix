14.  Francis Van Bartel desIsles, b.1801, d. 1884, 83 yrs.  Now that the French Revolution had established a                                                          
republic, the titles and remuneration from deLaunay, Villepelee, des Noes, duParc, etc. were ended and   never never used.
m. Betsy Berry, much devoted, d. 1898.  (Berry is a French name.  There is a large section of    France, like a state, named Berry.  Berrys were very early settlers at Trenton, before the Hopkins, Googins or Haynes)


ch. 1. Mary Elizabeth, b.1830, d. 1849
2. Adeline, b. 1831, d. 1873, m. Capt. Warren P. Haynes	(Adeline taught school at Trenton,  Ma.)
													
3. Chesnel, b. 1-27-1833 (illeg. 1827-27?1833) d. 2-2-1865 at Motts, Nev. of  smallpox, m.      1 week to Ann Emery?, or Mary Austin?, Eden Maine?   All information has been destroyed as Edwin and Isaac wanted to claim his money.  I found one paper in Ellsworth saying they were the only living heirs, not taking into consideration the children of their sister, Adeline.  Chesnel, of course, was named for the husband of Louis' favorite sister at whose house he was a guest for 25 yrs. After he left his family t shift for themselves in America.  Louis probably thought he could get some of the money due him which Chesnel had been taking for himself.  He was President of the Dept. of Orme in which Alencon is and could juggle things around.  It did work.
4. Isaac, m. Nellie Thomas.  (He left wife and child and disappeared after the first daughter.  Many man in his company settled nearby.) 
Francis went to France at his father's request when he was 41 to prove to the authorities that Louis did have a family in America.  His father gave little presents and a picture of himself to take back to each child.
Louis died 1843 and each child then received about $600 through a lawyer, M. duHammel.

None of the desIsles in America knew nor bothered to learn French.  As the final "s" on desIsles was not pronounced, they left it off.  So it is on a street sign in Bar Harbour and on headstones in the graveyard, and the remaining desIsles so spell it.

We have some letters from Chesnel, Isaac and Edwin to Adeline written in California, also some from John deLaittre, her cousin, to her.

When Warren and Adeline Haynes died, Anna and Nellie, 11 and 2, went to live with Grandfather Francis and Grandmother Betsy.  Although Anna did all the work, they charged the small estate for their keep.  At 14, Anna was sent to Bar Harbour to work for nothing in Edwin's hotel.  It was there that she met my father.  Nellie was lame(one leg about 6" shorter than the other) and was always frail, and no one thought she would live long, but she lived to be 67.
