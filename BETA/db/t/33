Besure to remember your password.  If there is any change and the system

$ Looks like I let missed a permission bug.  I have it fixed now.  But it

$ Hello...
At least I've figured out how to use tthe Post-It-Note Board...
For some reason, I was having troubles before.

$ Subject: new areas
 
    I've moved the Shrine to an entirely new area, the top of the cliff.
Getting to it is tricky, but it leaves room for some expansion  --  I know
Jon Cline in particular didn't like the idea of a cramped map, and we might
have run into trouble with overlapping rooms.
    However, you can still reach the Shrine through the secret door in the
Play Rooms.  A magic entrance, perhaps?

$ The swimming program for the river doesn't work yet, so until it does,
use 'sw' (southwest) to get into the beaverpond -- which is how most people
get into the river in the first place...
